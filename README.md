# House_Price_Prediction
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on size using simple Linear Regression. It uses Streamlit for an interactive UI and visualizes results graph using Matplotlib.

** Features
- Synthetic data generation for house sizes and prices
- Linear Regression model training and prediction
- User input for house size to estimate price
- Interactive data visualization

** Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib

** How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. use the command : streamlit run "file_name.py"


** Future Improvements
- Include more house features like location, bedrooms, bathrooms ( like  Sydney - 2BHK, London - 3BHK, Delhi - 4BHK )
- Try more advanced regression ( multiple linear or Polynamial regression ) models

see you soon with the next version ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
